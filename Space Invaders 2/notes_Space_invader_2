The super().__init() function in a child class, allows to inherit all the intialized 
variables from the parent class, instead of having to rewrite it again. 
The variables you put in the brackets in that function, are the variables needed
to define the variables already intizalied in the parent class. 







<============In the Player class I defined a "mask"===========>

^ A mask allows the image to set each pixel of the image to be sett to 0 or 1. 
If the mask interacts with another mask, the pixel turns on, 
and a COLLISION is detected. 





<=============================CONTINUE KEYWORD===================>

The continue keyword, is used so that the loop continues to the next iteration of the loop. So the loop will stop at continue, and restart from the beginning 





<<<<<<<<<<==========Collision function==============>>>>>>>>>>

We passed on "self" as a parameter, because since we already defined a mask as an
attribute in the intializaion process, we can just pass in "self" as a parameter
because self is the specfic instance
